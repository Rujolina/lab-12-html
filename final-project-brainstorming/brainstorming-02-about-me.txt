about me section will consist of 1-2 photos

My name is Lilia and I'm a student at New York City College Of Technology.
Growing in Queens, I've been greatly surrounded by music and the arts from
all sorts of cultures and backgrounds. And now at the age of 20, I hope to pursue
a career in music, never losing sight of the appreciation I've built up.

Striving for a career in music production I've find myself building a catalog of
skills well rounded to begin my journey in the music industry. I started out originally
with a strong love for musical performance. I grew up playing different instruments, such
as piano and guitar, as well as vocal performances. My high school life mostly revolved
around school performances focused on both solo and group renditions of a wide range of genres
as well as some original compositions.

Starting college, I found a new interest for music production bloom. In the past few years,
I've developed skills and experience with DAWs such as Protools and Logic, as well as
with systems and technology such as Dolby Atmos, Ambisonics, and various mixing consoles and
recording equipment additionally.
